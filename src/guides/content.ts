            <h2>Design & Customize Your Sliding Windows</h2>
            <p>Create your dream sliding window design with 2-track, 3-track, 4-shutter, or 6-shutter options — all customizable as per your space. Select glass thickness, choose from clear, tinted, or frosted glass, or even upload your own texture to visualize your window before making it real.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Design Your Sliding System</h3>
            <p>The sliding window designer allows for a wide range of configurations. Here’s how to use it effectively:</p>

            <h4>1. Track & Shutter Configuration</h4>
            <p>Begin by choosing your track and shutter setup.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2-Track:</strong> Supports <strong>2-Shutter</strong> and <strong>4-Shutter</strong> configurations.</li>
                <li><strong>3-Track:</strong> Supports <strong>3-Shutter</strong> and <strong>2-Shutter + 1 Mesh</strong> configurations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. Fixed Shutters</h4>
            <p>You can make any shutter a fixed panel. In the "Track & Shutter Setup" section, simply check the box for each shutter you want to fix in place.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Glass & Texture</h4>
            <p>In the "Appearance" section, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select from various <strong>glass types</strong> (Clear, Frosted, Tinted, etc.).</li>
                <li>Specify the exact <strong>glass thickness</strong> required for your project.</li>
                <li>Upload a custom <strong>texture image</strong> to visualize special glass types or finishes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2.5em;">Q&A – Sliding Windows</h3>

            <h2>Design Casement Windows, Doors & Foldable Systems Online</h2>
            <p>Create openable windows, single & double casement doors, fold & slide systems — all customizable with real hardware and profile options.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Design Your Casement System</h3>
            <p>This module is for creating versatile designs with fixed glass panels and openable doors (casements). You can design single windows, large multi-panel doors, and simulate more complex systems like bi-fold doors.</p>

            <h4>1. Grid Layout & Doors</h4>
            <p>Use the "Grid Layout" section to define rows and columns. Click on any panel in the grid preview to toggle it between a <strong>Fixed Panel</strong> and an <strong>Openable Door</strong>.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Simulating Advanced Designs</h4>
            <p>While direct "bi-fold" or "slide-and-fold" types are not single-click options, you can easily simulate these designs for visualization and quotation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bi-fold / Foldable Doors:</strong> Create a series of narrow openable doors next to each other to represent a bi-fold system.</li>
                <li><strong>Fold & Slide Systems:</strong> Combine fixed and openable panels to approximate the layout of a fold-and-slide system. The tool supports this with smooth transition previews and accurate material estimates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Hardware Customization</h4>
            <p>In the "Handle Configuration" section, you can apply custom handles to your openable doors. The costs for hinges, locks, and other hardware are managed within your selected <strong>Profile Series</strong>, ensuring your quotation is accurate.</p>

            <h3>How do I save my custom profiles?</h3>
            <p>In the "Profile Series" section, you can adjust the dimensions of any standard profile. Once you're happy with the dimensions, click "Save as New...", give it a unique name, and it will be saved to your browser for future use.</p>

            <h3>Is my data saved?</h3>
            <p>Yes, all your designs, quotation items, and custom profiles are automatically saved in your web browser's local storage. This means your data stays on your computer and is available the next time you open the tool on the same device.</p>
